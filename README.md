Hospital

The system administrator has access to the list of Doctors by categories (pediatrician, traumatologist, surgeon, ...) and the list of Patients. Implement the ability to sort:
1) patients:
- in alphabetical order;
- by date of birth;
2) doctors:
- in alphabetical order;
- by category;

The administrator registers patients and doctors in the system and appoints a doctor for the patient.
The doctor determines the diagnosis, makes appointments to the patient (procedures, medications, operations), which are recorded in the Hospital Card. The appointment can be made by a Nurse (procedures, medications) or a Doctor (any appointment).
The patient can be discharged from the hospital, with a definitive diagnosis.
